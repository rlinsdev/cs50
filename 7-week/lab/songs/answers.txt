I'm not sure, because I don't know anyone of these artists in this list... But looks like a playlist from a teenager. Maybe Orange and Blue

First, I think will be necessary to score each music to a specific type, and then, add more scores or less, in the same type.
With this, will be easy to get de average for all songs in a specific user, and then, will be easy to show the result
