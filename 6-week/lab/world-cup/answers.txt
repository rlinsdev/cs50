Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

I didn't realize incorrect results or some countries with low win rates winning a lot in this simulation... Apparently, everything is normal..

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

Maybe in a big system in a large company, te time will be essential to some program, but to a simple simulate, I thinks this is good enough
