# Project - CS50 2023


## OAuth project:
This is a OAuth project solution. With this, we will provide to users a single approach authentication.

Building with `node.js` (back-end Javascript) application, working with `express APP` (web framework for node.js) with `mongoDb` (NoSql DataBase).
The idea, is build a project with this technologies working with `Passportjs` (Authentication middleware for node) that will help future developers who want a solution to integrate the systems.
At first, this working with: Facebook, Google and GitHub TODO: estes 3 mesmo?
