# Project - CS50 2023


## OAuth project:
This is a `node.js` (back-end Javascript) application, working with `express APP` (web framework for node.js) with `mongoDb` (NoSql DataBase).
The idea, is build a project with this technologies working with `Passportjs` (Authentication middleware for node) that will help future developers who want a solution to integrate the systems, with a unified login like a google, facebook and twitter
This project will.

One similar project was did to make a microservice in my company, to focus in one single point to login in platform, and keep the user logged in and accessing all the system.
